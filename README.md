# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)

This project uses a **Logistic Regression** model to detect **credit card fraud** using machine learning. It is trained on a dataset where transactions are classified as:

- `0` → Fraudulent (Fake)
- `1` → Legitimate (Genuine)

The model achieves an accuracy of **96.77%**, making it a reliable tool for binary classification of transaction legitimacy.

- `0` → Fraudulent
- `1` → Legitimate

> **Note:** The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent cases being rare compared to legitimate ones.
